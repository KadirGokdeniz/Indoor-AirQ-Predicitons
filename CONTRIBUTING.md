## üñ•Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ 
- Git
- Jupyter Notebook/JupyterLab
- A virtual environment tool (venv, conda, etc.)

### Local Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   # Click 'Fork' on GitHub, then clone your fork
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/air-smart-controller.git
   cd air-smart-controller
   ```

2. **Set up virtual environment**
   ```bash
   # Using venv
   python -m venv airquality-env
   source airquality-env/bin/activate  # Windows: airquality-env\Scripts\activate
   
   # OR using conda
   conda create -n airquality-env python=3.8
   conda activate airquality-env
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # If available
   ```

4. **Verify installation**
   ```bash
   # Test the Streamlit app
   streamlit run Smart-Air.py
   
   # Test Jupyter notebook
   jupyter notebook Air_Quality_Prediction.ipynb
   ```

### Development Dependencies

For development, you may need additional packages:
```bash
pip install pytest black flake8 isort jupyter-notebook mypy
```

## üìù Contributing Guidelines

### Code Style

- **Python**: Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- **Formatting**: Use `black` for code formatting
  ```bash
  black --line-length 88 .
  ```
- **Linting**: Use `flake8` for linting
  ```bash
  flake8 --max-line-length=88 --extend-ignore=E203,W503 .
  ```
- **Import sorting**: Use `isort`
  ```bash
  isort --profile black .
  ```

### Jupyter Notebook Guidelines

- **Clear outputs** before committing:
  ```bash
  jupyter nbconvert --clear-output --inplace Air_Quality_Prediction.ipynb
  ```
- **Add markdown cells** to explain complex analysis steps
- **Include comments** in code cells for clarity
- **Use meaningful variable names** and avoid single-letter variables
- **Document model hyperparameters** and their rationale

### Data Handling Standards

- **Never commit large datasets** to the repository
- **Use relative paths** for data file references
- **Document data sources** and preprocessing steps
- **Include data validation checks** in your code
- **Respect data privacy** and licensing agreements

### Model Development Guidelines

1. **Baseline Comparison**: Always compare new models against existing baselines
2. **Reproducibility**: Set random seeds and document environment
3. **Performance Metrics**: Include comprehensive evaluation metrics
4. **Documentation**: Explain model architecture choices and hyperparameter decisions
5. **Validation**: Use proper train/validation/test splits
